Run this in a tor directory as follows:

rm -rf OUT_SPLIT && python csplit.py src/{or,common}/*.[ch]

It will fill OUT_SPLIT with the C files, split into functions.

Then, run it again in another Tor directory.

Then do:
  diff -urN $tordir1/OUT_SPLIT $tordir2/OUT_SPLIT

and it might tell you the differences between moved functions, if any.


Maybe it doesn't work; good luck.
